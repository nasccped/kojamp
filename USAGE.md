## Help

Prints a help panel of the program or the given subcommand.
It can be called as a subcommand or a flag too!

This:

```sh
kojamp --help
```

works the same as this:

```sh
kojamp help
```

Calling the help panel for a subcommand will work:

```sh
# this way
kojamp help subcommand_name

# or this way
kojamp subcommand_name --help
```

## New

Creates a Java/Kotlin project in a new directory.

<h3 id="new-rules-usage-and-examples">Rules, usage and examples</h3>

Some rules and examples to use the `new` subcommand properly:

<h4 id="new-project-name">Project name:</h4>

Due to Java conventions, file and class names should be camel cased.
The name of the project main file (file that contains the
[`main`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/public-static-void-main-string-args-java-main-method)
function) will be the same as the project name, so if you run
`kojamp new NameTesting --kind java`, the output will be a project which contains
a `NameTesting.java` file:

```java
public class NameTesting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // some code here ...
    }
}
```

Any name that:

- doesn't follow the camel case rules (`lowercaseStarting`);
- contains invalid chars (`Slashes/Acc√©ntsAnd_underscores`);
- contains white spaces (`Compound Name`);
- other obvious Java programming crimes...

will result in an `invalid project name` error that will be reported
at the terminal.

<h4 id="new-project-kind">Project kind:</h4>

You should specify the project kind by using the `--kind` flag (`-K`
as alias). The project kind value can only be `java` or `kotlin`
_(no case sensitive)_. Any different value will result in an
`invalid project kind` error that will be reported at the terminal.
Here's an example:

```sh
# creates a java project
kojamp new JavaProjectExample --kind java

# creates a kotlin project
kojamp new KotlinProjectExample -K kotlin

# result in an error
kojamp new OtherKindProjectExample --kind invalid-kind
```

<h4 id="new-project-path">Project path:</h4>

When creating a new project, the path name will be auto-generated by
taking the project name and turning it into a kebab case name.
Basically:

- `ThisProject` results in `this-project` path name
- `Java2Project` results in `java2-project` path name
- you get it...

But you can specify the project path name by using the `--path` or
`-P` flag. When running
`kojamp new KotlinGuy -K kotlin -P some-name`, the generated project
will have the following file tree:

```txt
üóÇÔ∏è  some-name
‚îú‚îÄ üóÇÔ∏è  src
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ üèùÔ∏è  KotlinGuy.kt
‚îú‚îÄ üè∑Ô∏è  .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ üìÉ  Kojamp.toml
‚îî‚îÄ üì∞  README.md
```

It's useful when you want to create the `ChessBot` project but
there's  already a `chess-bot` directory.

<h4 id="new-project-authors">Project authors:</h4>

The `--authors`/`-A` flag can receive just one value as parameter, so
to set an author when creating a new project you can try this:

```sh
kojamp ... --authors Yourself
```

If you want to set a compound name author (or more than one author)
you can use quotes (and commas) like when running `git commit`:

```sh
# this will create a project with a single author (compound name)
kojamp new ... --authors "A guy that loves programming"

# this will create a project with multiple authors
kojamp new ... --authors "Nascc, Ped, Peter"
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You doesn't need to worry about white spaces. The kojamp program
> will handle it for you:
>
> - [`"So` ` ` ` ` `much` ` ` `spaces"`] author becomes `"So much spaces"`

<h4 id="new-no-git">No git:</h4>

It's useful when you want to create a new project with no git
repository (when using an alternative
[vcs](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-version-control),
e. g.);

```sh
# will create a foo-bar directory without git repo initialization (also no .gitignore)
kojamp new FooBar --kind java --no-git
```

## Init

Creates a Java/Kotlin project in the current directory. (Can also be called with `ini`)

| `force`   | **no alias** | (called with flag) | `--force`                                    | Forces the project initializing (even if isn't an empty dir)        | No ‚ùå    |
| `help`    | `-h`         | (called with flag) | `--help [-h]`                                | Print the help panel for the `init` subcommand                       | No ‚ùå    |

<h3 id="init-rules-usage-and-examples">Rules, usage and examples</h3>

A bunch of fields was already explained at [new section](#new).
Bellow, you'll find infos about

<h4 id="init-force">Force:</h4>

Project initializing at **non empty dirs** isn't allowed, but you can
still force it by using the `force` flag.

```sh
# You'll need to be in a non empty dir to test it
kojamp init Avaj -K java --force
```

It will will ignore the empty dir rule and initialize the project.
It'll also preserve some auto-generated project files/dirs such as
`README.md` and `.git` folder (cancel git initialization).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The directory shouldn't have a `src`, `out` dirs or a `Kojamp.toml`
> file. These components are mandatory to the program build and run.
> Otherwise, the process will fail and the program will print an
> error message.
