WARN MESSAGE ðŸ’£
==============

The `Kojamp` app is under big changes such as:

- stack (from `Java/C` to `Rust`)
- library (using `clap` lib)
- design pattern (~~trying to~~ implement Builder+Strategy DP)

So far we have the following implementations:

- [x] `kojamp new` to create a project in a new directory
- [ ] `kojamp init (ini)` to create a project in the current
       directory _(missing features such as `--force`)_
- [ ] `kojamp build (b)` to compile the project source code
- [ ] `kojamp run (r)` to _(build and)_ run the project bytecode
- [x] `kojamp help` to print the help panel

## How to use

### Create a new project âœ¨

You can use two subcommands:

1. `kojamp new` to create a new project in a new directory
2. `kojamp init (or ini)` to create a new project in the current
    directory (may fail for non-empty paths - fixing soon)

For `new` subcommand, it should be called this way:

```sh
kojamp new <PROJECT_NAME> --kind <PROJECT_KIND>
```

Obviously, you can choose the values of `<PROJECT_NAME>` and
`<PROJECT_KIND>`, but the first one should be CamelCased and have no
special chars, whitespaces... . The second one should be `java` or
`kotlin` _(no case sensitive)_. Any other value will result in a
fail.

The project path will be auto-generated by the program by turning
the `<PROJECT_NAME>` into a kebab case value, but you can also
specify a path by using `--path <PATH_HERE>` flag.

Here's an example:

```sh
kojamp new MyJavaProject --kind java --path test-path
```

The `init` subcommand works the same way as `new`, but it doesn't
allow `--path` flag!
