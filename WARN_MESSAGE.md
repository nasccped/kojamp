WARN MESSAGE
============

This project is under some changes (stack, design pattern, publishing
concept). You can use it to have fun but isn't recommended to use for
commercial use!

So far we have the following implementations:

- [x] `kojamp new`
- [ ] `kojamp init (ini)` _(missing features such as `--force`)_
- [ ] `kojamp build (b)`
- [ ] `kojamp run (r)`
- [x] `kojamp help`
